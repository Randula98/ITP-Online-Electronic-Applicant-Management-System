#### Brief Description of Project - 
<P>
‘Synthetic Dealz’ is a company that has been founded in 2010 and has a large customer base with
a well-known positive reputation for the company’s quality of the electronic applicants.
Since its small beginning, Synthetic Dealz has been able to expand its product range and, as of
right now, has been successful in securing the partnership of numerous leading companies,
including Samsung, Hisense, HP, Oppo, Vivo and Havells. Synthetic Dealz is a well-known
company involved in electronic applicant retail and wholesale marketing. And Sri Lanka's one of
the largest online retailers offers flexible pricing on laptops, air conditioners, mobile phones, TVs
and washing machines. Synthetic Dealz service centers are well-equipped with a wide range of

This Electronic applicant marketing management system is a web-based application that handles
different sections of the company. This web-based application contains 8 main functions as
Customer Management, Finance Management, HR management, Sales Management, Stock
Management, Service Management, Supplier Management and Purchase Management.
We mostly concerned to find the best solutions to the current situation in the country like
transport issues and to reduce the number of customers in the showrooms due to the COVID-19
pandemic. So, we decided to build an online web-based application. The company will be able to
seek bigger and new opportunities because of this integrated system and this system helps
company to make virtual appointments with the customers. Keeping track of profiles, updating,
deleting, and reaching employee and customer profiles is made simpler by this system. Rather
than that customer can order and buy the electrical equipment through this web-based application
and company will give an efficient delivery for them.
